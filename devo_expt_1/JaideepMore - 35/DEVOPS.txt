What is DevOps?
What is Version Control?

CI - Continuous Integration: Jenkins
    What is ?
        Developers commit code to a shared repository
        VCS is being monitored. When a commit is made the build will be triggered
        Build not successful then notification to the developers

    Why?
        Detect problems or bugs as early as possible in the development cycle
        Since entire code base is integreated built and tested constantly the potential bugs and errors are cought earlier
    
    Different Phases
        Stage1: 
            No build servers
            Developers commit on regular basis
            changes are integreated and tested manually
            fewer releases
        Stage2:
            Automated builds are scheduled
            Build script compiles the applixation and runs a set of automated tests
            Build servers would alter the team members if build failure
        Stage3:
        Stage4:
            Automated code quality and code coverage metrics
        Stage5: 
            Automated Deployment
